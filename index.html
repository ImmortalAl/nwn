                <p class="date-stamp mb-4">January 9th, 2025</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The United States House passed a bill sanctioning anyone who assists the ICC</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on November 21st, 2024, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The charges include alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza conflict, such as using starvation as a method of warfare and blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza. These actions are said to have caused severe harm to civilians, violating international law.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Israel's Response</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected the ICC's authority and legitimacy, stating that Israel will appeal the decision. The Israeli government has formally requested the ICC to suspend the warrants while the appeal is processed.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">International Reactions</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">United States:</span> The Biden administration criticized the ICC's decision, with bipartisan calls for sanctions against the court.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">European Union:</span> EU countries are divided. France and Italy have questioned the feasibility of enforcing the warrants due to immunity claims, while others emphasize support for the ICC's independence.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">South Africa and Namibia:</span> Both countries welcomed the ICC's decision, highlighting it as a step toward justice for Palestinians.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Implications</h3>
                <p>The warrants could significantly restrict Netanyahu's international travel to ICC member states, as these nations are obligated to enforce the arrest. However, Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, complicating enforcement.</p>
