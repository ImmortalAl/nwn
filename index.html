                    <li><span class="font-semibold">June 6, 2025:</span> The Trump administration announced sanctions on four ICC judgesâ€”Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou (Benin), Beti Hohler (Slovenia), Solomy Balungi Bossa (Uganda), and Luz Del Carmen Ibanez Carranza (Peru)â€”freezing their U.S. assets and barring Americans from doing business with them. The move was in response to ICC investigations into alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as U.S. actions in Afghanistan. The ICC, UN, and EU condemned the sanctions as an attack on judicial independence and the rule of law.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">February 2025:</span> President Trump issued an executive order declaring any ICC effort to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute U.S. or allied nationals a threat to U.S. national security, imposing economic sanctions and travel bans on ICC officials and their families.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">November 2024:</span> ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three senior Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. The move drew protests from the U.S. and Israel. Khan stepped aside in May 2025 amid a UN-led sexual misconduct probe.</li>

                    <li>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and operates under the Rome Statute with 125 member states.</li>
                    <li>Neither the U.S. nor Israel is a party to the Rome Statute and does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction.</li>
