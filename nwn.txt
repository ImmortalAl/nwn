            <h2>ICC Issues Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on November 21, 2024, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</p>
            <h3>Israel's Response</h3>
            <p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected the ICC's authority and legitimacy, stating that Israel will appeal the decision. The Israeli government has formally requested the ICC to suspend the warrants while the appeal is processed.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>South Africa and Namibia: Both countries welcomed the ICC's decision, highlighting it as a step toward justice for Palestinians.</li>
                <li>European Union: EU countries are divided. France and Italy have questioned the feasibility of enforcing the warrants due to immunity claims, while others emphasize support for the ICC's independence.</li>
                <li>United States: The Biden administration criticized the ICC's decision, with bipartisan calls for sanctions against the court.</li>
